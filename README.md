# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project

## Overview
The company Pewlett-Hackard wanted to know how many current employees will soon be up for retirement and how many employees they have available to mentor those approaching promotion or hire to replace the retirees. By having this data readily available, the company will be able to make decisions with significant forethought. 

## Results
- There is a significant amount of employees approaching retirement that currently hold senior positions within the company. As these elder employees move towards retirement, this gap in experience means over 30,000 younger employees must be hired or mentored and promoted. They will also require sufficient time to gain experience to perform at high capacity in senior positions. 
- There are only 1,549 current employees that have eligibility to be mentors, according to the criteria set by the company, which places significant backlog in effective mentorship in addition to sustainable workloads for the employees available to mentor the younger generation.
